<h1>Can we write programs?</h1><small>Of course we can!</small>
<p>It was a big tricky, but we eventually figured out how to compile with the library
on Sand. Here is our less than astounding program that uses threads:</p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;boost/thread.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    void wait(int seconds) {

        boost::this_thread::sleep(boost::posix_time::seconds(seconds));
    }

    void thread() {

        for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {

            wait(1);
            std::cout << i << std::endl;
            }
        }

    int main() {

        // Sneak peak! Don't stare too hard at it yet.
        boost::thread t(thread);
        t.join();
    }
</pre>
<p>Then we compile with this command: </p>
<pre>g++ -I /usr/include test.cc -o test -lboost_thread -lboost_system</pre>
<p>This is the magic command that helps us to compile. I'll it step by step.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The -I indicates where the header files for the program are located. Binder made it a seek and find
    by hiding them in <pre>/usr/include/</pre> rather than the typical <pre>/usr/local/include</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        The next three arguments are pretty standard compiler commands. Take that source file, output the executable
        with the given name.
    </li>
    <li>
        The next two arguments: <pre>lboost_thread</pre> and <pre>-lboost_system</pre> tell the linker that we want
        it to stitch in the <span class="italic">built</span> library files. Half of the boost library are simple
        functions that can be inserted inline, but the other half are architecture specific, so they must be built.
    </li>
    <div class="info-box">
        The second link command was very tricky. We kept getting an error that something was missing, and so
        StackOverflow came to the rescue and told us what missing library files we should link.
        <pre>error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line</pre>
    </div>
</ul>
